                <p>
                <br></br>
                A senior at the University of Michigan and a freelance photographer from Chicago IL. I shoot sports, senior photos, private events, graduation photos, nature, and weddings, but my passion lies within capturing peopleâ€™s honest emotions.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                My camera has become my passport to exploring the world's natural wonders. From the mountains of Vail Colorado to the serene shores of Hawaii, my camera is how I feel a deep connection to the earth's beauty. Through my lens, I strive to share the awe and bliss I experienced in those quiet moments of solitude amidst nature's wonder.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                People are my passion, and there's an honesty in candid shots that reveal the true essence of human connections. I found myself capturing laughter, tears, excitement, and the simple shared moments that build the foundation of cherished memories. I hope to give people a token for those memories.
